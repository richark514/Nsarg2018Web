<p class="green title center"> How and when it all started</p>

<p class="purple text"> The Northampton Scout Amateur Radio Group had its
first meeting in 1981 and spent its first few years moving around local Scout troop huts
and then into a local School where the caretaker was a very active short wave listener. 
(I remember spending many hours in his shack Ed.)</p>

<p class="purple text"> During the early years the group used to travel on
Saturdays to the Radio Station at Gilwell Park, helping them to run courses and entertain
Scouts and visitors from all over the world. When we first started going to Gilwell
it was decided to move the radio station from its old location on the Branchet 
Field to its present location at the back of &quot;the Lid&quot;.&nbsp; Erecting antennas, 
carrying out major building work and rewiring taught us a lot.</p>

<p class="purple text">These lessons became invaluable a few years later when our dream became true and NSARG
had the offer of a building that we could call our shack.</p>

<p class="purple text">The only trouble was we had to dismantle it, move it from the other side of town
and rebuild it at the Scout training ground.</p>

<p class="purple text">So with the help of the Overstone Service Team and
a few of our friends from Gilwell Scout Amateur Radio Group we started the task on the
Bank holiday weekend in August 1985. After a lot of swearing, loss of blood, and good old
Scout initiative the building was moved to its present location; by the end of the weekend
the building was half re-erected.</p>

<p class="purple text">The hard work had only just begun. We had two months to have the building operational
for JOTA (Jamboree on the Air). We spent most evenings and weekends working on the
interior of the building and on the Friday of Jota we were operational.</p>

<p class="purple text">The group uses the callsigns: G6NDS, G0NDS and GB4NDS.</p>

<p class="purple text">The group runs courses for Scout Radio Communicator, 
Scout Electronics, Scout
Radio Communicator Instructor and Information Technology Staged badge 
courses. In recent years our membership has expanded to cater for all sections 
of the Movement. A number of Cub Scouts have joined the Group and we now have 
our own specialist <a href="marconi.html">Explorer Scout Unit.</a> Our range of 
Activity Badge courses is expanding to cover the requirements of badges 
available to the Beaver, Cub and Explorer sections as well as improving our 
Scout section training.</p>

<p class="purple text">In addition to courses for Activity 
Badges, the Group has organised a number of courses for Scouts to obtain their 
own Amateur Radio licences and we have several Foundation, Intermediate and 
Advanced licensees amongst our members.</p>

<p class="purple text">The group was formed to give the Scouts of Northampton the opportunity 
to learn about Radio Scouting and associated technology based activities. 
Many have obtained their own amateur radio licences and some have gone on to 
follow careers in the radio, electronics or computer industry.</p>
